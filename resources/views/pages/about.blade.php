       <h1>What is lingo</h1>
	   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(Dutch_game_show)">Lingo</a><sup>1</sup> was a Dutch television game show produced by AVROTROS (earlier VARA, later TROS). Lingo is a word game that combines the games Mastermind and Bingo. Two teams of two contestants each try to guess and spell words, after being given a letter in the word and the length of the word. The length of the word that has to be guessed varies from five to eight letters, and depends on the round.</p>
	   <p>The game show aired daily starting in 1989 on one of Holland's public television channels. On July 30, 2014, it was announced that Lingo would stop producing new episodes starting in September 2014 due to declining ratings.[1] The final episode aired on October 2, 2014.</p>
		<h1>Rules of the game</h1>
	   <p>Originally, each team had to guess 5-letter words. Later, the game was played with 6-letter words and, on Fridays, 7-letter words. Starting from 2013, games start out with 5-letter words, then progress to 6- and 7-letter words, and finish with a word that contains 8 letters. The game on this site only offers 5-letter words.
		<br><br>
		The participant is given the first letter of an unknown 5 letter word. The guess must be a valid Dutch word which is spelled correctly and contains the correct number of letters. The guess must then be spelled out. If the word is correctly spelled, the word is shown in a 5x5 grid. Letters of the guess that are in the same position as that of the unknown word are shown in red. Letters that appear in the unknown word but are in the wrong position are shown in a yellow circle. Any correct letters which are in the correct position are automatically dropped to the next line.
		The participant gets to guess the correct word within five turns or lose the game. 
		Unusual words such as verb conjugations (e.g. "speaks") are considered valid words for a participant to guess for the sake of giving themselves clues as to the real word, but are never the correct answer.</p>
